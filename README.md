# Z2M 2.0.0 Compatible HA-BluePrints
Home Assistant Zigbee2Mqtt (Z2M) Blueprints I use.

Credit goes to original creators not sure where most have come from.

In Z2M 2.0.0 the sensor.\<DEVICE\>_action is depracated.
I updated these blueprints to work for all my devices and will work with z2m > 2.0.0.
